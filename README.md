# Trippy (in progress) #

### Make trip plans in realtime with your friends! ###
* Part of the Main family hackathon, MAINATHON. 72 hours, make a cool MVP.
* App that hybridizes chat rooms and trip planners. No more passing around links in a Facebook group or chat thread.
* Real-time chat and real-time creation of Waypoints(Google Maps, Directions, Places, AirBnB listings, etc.) so that everyone can see these things in the same place at the same time.

### In Progress. Todos: ###
* Implement final index/entry design. It'll be way shiny!
* Maps waypoint integration.
* Authentication/ownership.
* Server-side rendering.
* Micro-ui polishing across app.
